# Introduction

Welcome! If you're here, you're likely a Fifth-Row leader or Student Club hopeful. 

The guides here are meant to help you with navigating the organizational processes of SUTD, and hopefully to ensure that we can get **better** at processes and smooth things over more.

# How to Use This Repository

This repo is meant as a storehouse of knowledge, so if you see anything you'd like to add on as a fifth-row leader or just anything at all about navigating organizational processes, feel free to submit a pull request!
