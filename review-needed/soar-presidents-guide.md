# SOAR Presidents' Guide and SOP

## Introduction

This guide serves as a living document to all current and future presidents of the SUTD Organization of Autonomous Robotics (as it is known as of 2018), or should any future SUTD robotics organization surface in it's place. This document will attempt to outline the SOAR president's roles, responsibilities, standard operating procedures as well as dispense advice and cautions where applicable. The guide will attempt to generalized where possible but care should be taken to keep this document as up to date as possible - especially when a hand-over of executive committee positions is imminent.

The SOAR president has a the challenging and at times unenviable task of guaranteeing the club's short-term success as well as long-term growth. This task is also further complicated by the reality of the SUTD curriculum - the president is likely to be inundated with academic work as well as other commitments (academic or otherwise). Additionally, if the SOAR president performs poorly in academics, it is likely that he/she will be requested to step down by their academic mentor. Due to this, it is imperative that selection of a successor consider the following qualities:

- Good time management
- Interest and Commitment to the field of robotics / Artificial Intelligence (AI) or related fields
- Decent Academic Standing / Results

These should be the bare minimum requirements when considering a successor. Failing any of these will make it hard for the candidate to fulfill the basic roles of the SOAR president. As SOAR continues to grow in scope and clout, it is likely that the successive SOAR presidents will face the daunting task of guiding this organization amidst challenging conditions. 

However, due to these challenges, the SOAR president role will allow an individual to grow commensurably with each successful project, milestone or update. Working in such a position would also provide many opportunities for the individual to network with peers, seniors, alumni and even industry professionals. Finally, the position would allow the individual to be one of the custodians for the student-led robotics ecosystem in SUTD - an exciting task for anyone seeking to develop experience in managing and leading a robotics organization and an invaluable addition to one's portfolio.

It is with this that I encourage any aspiring or selected SOAR president to take on this task with ownership and professionalism - the journey would not be easy but only you can make it worth it.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The SOAR president's role and responsibilities can become very fluid - the individual must be able to adapt quickly to changing situations and not be fixated and compartmentalized to his/her own role. This is because of the dynamic environment that SUTD is as well as the wavering and at times unpredictable commitment levels of the SUTD student populace. The SOAR president may well find himself/herself in a situation where:

- A project leader goes missing and leaves a project to fail
- An executive committee member fails to do their job, risking a failure in organizational processes
- Expectations are poorly communicated, resulting in an suboptimal project
- Faculty or SUTD Staff backtracking on their verbal agreements

The above are just some of the possible scenarios - due to the dynamic nature of the position, it can be hard to predict all possible edge cases. While this guide will try to highlight some of the possible (or sometimes, actual) incidents, it is by no means an exhaustive list and the individual is expected to be proactive and vigilant when dealing with the unexpected.

So what exactly are the SOAR president's roles and responsibilities then? In a broad form, they can be distilled to the following:

- Dictate club direction and guide the club's activities and proceedings to be in alignment with said direction
- Ensure efficient operation of the executive committee
- Secure new opportunities for the club and ensure that these opportunities are fulfilled to the requirements set by the stakeholders

### Dictate Club Direction

The SOAR president is in many ways, the primary custodian for the club. Alumni and Faculty may offer their advice, but ultimately the power resides in this individual. This means that the SOAR president has an important hand in dictating the direction for the club. As of writing, the club mission can be broken into two parts:

- Equip members with industry-relevant skills (such as ROS, openCV, Arduino, Solidworks)
- Improve the club's standing in the industry and research fields (so as to garner more opportunities)

These two tenets stem from the current club direction: To prepare members for industrial level robotics after graduation (as of 2018)

This direction in itself is what arguably a university level robotics club should aspire to be - to be the bridge between high-school level robotics (VEX, NXT, First Tech Challenge) and industry level robotics. One could argue that the main mission of SOAR is to generate industry qualified roboticists in the short 3 years that students spend in this club (or less if they join after the first year). 

Given this general direction, the President then makes further decisions on specific tasks an opportunities such as:

- Whether to accept a research project from SUTD Faculty
- Whether to accept an industry project from a company
- Whether to accept internship offers for club members from a company
- Whether to take up a sponsorship from a company/organization
- Whether to procure a specific part/framework for club use

It is self-evident that the overall club-direction allows the president to frame each opportunity and decision in a specific manner that allows for improved efficiency in decision making. 

As an addition to this, the president also guides the club in the right direction - ensuring that activities align with the current club mission. It is important to ensure frequent review to projects as there is a tendency for scope/feature creep to cause a project to develop in a manner counterintuitive to the current industry trend. The president's task is made easier by the presence of a project manager but if said project manager proves ineffective (or perhaps there is a lack of a project manager), the president must be aware that this will become a priority concern. Poorly guided projects will result in a slow and unnoticed alteration to the club direction. If allowed to fester, it could result in the club completely misalign with the current industry trends or appetite - which is counterproductive to the mission of a university level robotics club.

### Ensure Efficient Operation of the Executive Committee (EXCO)

The president is both the head of SOAR as well as the head of the EXCO. In many ways, the efficiency of the EXCO dictates the efficiency of the club. The club cannot expect to achieve great things if it has improper leadership - or worse, inability to conduct day-to-day operations (such as finances and basic administrative tasks). This puts the president at a position where he/she is expected to ensure the EXCO operates at peak efficiency. The workflow of an EXCO varies from team to team but the president is expected to implement the following basic systems for the operation of the EXCO:

- A tasks distribution system to ensure every important task has been delegated to at least one EXCO member - this ensures that nothing slips through
  - As an aside, prior to 2017, SOAR lost a sponsorship from Intel because of the lack of persistent correspondence between SOAR and Intel. This could have been avoided if the task of updating Intel every month was delegated properly.
- An accountability system to ensure that EXCO members are held accountable for the tasks they are assigned. 
  - It is important that at the very least, the EXCO is able to be accountable and responsible for their actions. Failure to do so at the upper levels of the club will result in failure cascades down the hierarchy of the club. Ineffective and incompetent leadership will also drive away otherwise committed and interested members
- A system that allows change in responsibilities fluidly and rapidly
  - At times some EXCO members might require assistance or be unable to complete their tasks (the reasons may or may not be malicious). The systems in place should allow other EXCO members to fill in the gap quickly and efficiently.
  - One way this is achieved is by mandating that EXCO members read the backlog of the primary EXCO chat at all times to ensure that they have a level of understanding for every task - allowing them to transition quickly should they have to
  - This system should tie in with the accountability system - the original EXCO member who failed his responsibilities should be made accountable while the one who managed to salvage the situation should be recognized accordingly. Of course, sometimes the scope of a task might grow out of hand despite the best efforts to delegate a task efficiently - the president should always show discretion when calling out mistakes.

It is exactly the need for efficient operation that the selection of the EXCO usually involves selection of the president *first*, followed by the formation of a team around the president. The president should not have to work with someone he/she feels uncomfortable with, but at the same time the team should not be selected with excessive nepotism - some level of competence should be demanded. In most cases, the alumni and previous EXCO should offer their opinion and conduct some sort of on-the-job (OJT) training to evaluate the suitability of the candidates.

The efficiency of the EXCO cannot be underscored - many clubs have went under or became a shadow of their former selves due to inefficient and ineffective leadership. It is imperative that an effective EXCO be formed before actual hand-over concludes - lest they might undo years of work.

## The SOAR EXCO Team

As of the 2018 SOAR EXCO batch, the current team positions are outlined below:

- President - Overall club direction and face of the club
- Secretary - Handles all club administrative proceedings
- Treasurer - Handles all club procurement (expected to have a bank account with around 5000 SGD funds to handle purchases)
- Vice President - Handles the secondary EXCO tasks (primarily networking related), assists the President and offers a second pair of eyes on EXCO matters. The Vice President is also in charge of the Media and Networking EXCO members
- Media In-charge - Handles club's media (posters, photos, videos and manages the Instagram page)
- Networking In-charge - Handles the club's professional networking front (Linkedin and Facebook, participates in robotics events)
- Extra Committee Roles (these roles are generic and are given on a case-by-case basis - has to be justified to OSL):
  - Club Advisor: Seniors, Alumni who are actively involved in EXCO proceedings

### EXCO Position Pre-requisites

With the exception of the president, the main requirements for the SOAR EXCO members are the following:

- Interest in the club and direction
- Commitment to club sessions and more importantly, EXCO meetings

The ability to complete their various EXCO tasks can be taught during the OJT phase by prior EXCO members. However, interest and commitment are likely to be inherent traits to the individuals and would prove hard to cultivate from scratch. As an aside, it is more than likely that the average SUTD student would lose interest in demanding commitments especially once the ungraded part of the first year begins to hit (and everyone begins to focus more on academics).

With regards to the president however, there are additional requirements:

- Interest and Commitment to the club are mandatory
- Technical aptitude in robotics related domains *or, failing that*...
- Demonstrable ability to learn fast 
- It is also recommended that the president possesses the basic social skills required to interact and network with people (it might sounds obvious but this may not be a given)
  - This is important not because the President is the face of the club to industry and faculty alike
  - Additionally, the President has to do their best to maintain good relations with other clubs or authority figures to ensure smooth and efficient club operations as well as further opportunities for collaboration to develop organically

In the worst case scenario, the president might be expected to run the club with an incomplete EXCO team. During such cases, the president will be expected to be able to take over these roles as necessary.

## Dealing with Ineffective Executive Committee members

As an aside, one might wonder how to deal with ineffective EXCO members. In nearly all cases, the individual should already have been flagged during the OJT phase and can consequently be removed from the hand-over take-over (HOTO) process. During which, an alternative candidate should be sourced quickly. Once the alternative candidate has proven his or her worth, a separate HOTO form for that candidate can be submitted at a later date.

To avoid drama, the president should act impartially. But in cases where this is not possible due to the fact that the president will be interacting with the individual beyond SOAR - the former EXCO members and/or the vice-president can speak to the person instead. 

When speaking to the ineffective individual, seek to understand their point of view and why they have acted in the manner that they did. However, do not afford them another chance unless they can complete some sort of test to prove their commitment. The first part is to ascertain the point of failure as a learning experience to the EXCO as a whole - it is also a good way to understand the potential failure points for future candidates. Simultaneously, it provides a softer approach towards letting the individual go.

Unless the candidate can prove themselves, do not offer them a second chance as there will be very little room for mistakes once the OJT period is over. Poor initial attitude is unlikely to fix itself in short order and if a person is unable to even put on a façade of commitment throughout the OJT period, then it is unlikely that they will put in any long-term effort. Understand that this might not be because the individual is lazy, but most often it is because they simply lack alignment to the club and its goals. 

It is best to speak to the individual only after enough evidence has been gathered. This is not only to give the person a certain degree of leeway but also to ensure that there are concrete grounds for termination. Evidence may include the following:

- Poor attendance despite being an EXCO member
- Not being involved in any SOAR project without good reason
- Failure to conduct duties as an EXCO member due to attitude/aptitude/poor time-management

## Interacting with Office of Student Life

It is paramount that SOAR presidents understand the importance of favorable interactions with the Office of Student Life (OSL). Even if SOAR is able to proceed without the seed fund, there are many approvals that would require OSL. Keeping OSL in the loop of SOAR proceedings is important as it would allow SOAR to maintain in good standing with OSL and make future approvals smoother. 

OSL seeks situational awareness and understanding - this is because they are the body that oversees the student clubs. It is important to give them the appropriate control and the information they require as it would assist them in keeping tabs on SOAR. The additional advantages to keeping OSL in the loop include extra funding direct from OSL during claims. At it's core, OSL acts in the interest of SOAR and the student clubs - it is best to not see them as antagonists as this might worsen relations. Understand that with OSL, it is always possible to resolve any differences in an amicable manner. More importantly, it is paramount that such differences are indeed resolved amicably as there is potential for irrevocable long-term damage to be done to the club.

The easiest way to keep OSL in the loop is to send monthly emails of progress reports. This will also facilitate them in approving the pulse check documents. The reports can also be sent to Professor U-Xuan so as to "kill two birds with one stone" so as to speak.

However, it is important to note that while OSL might be kept in the loop, they are not obligated (and more specifically, tend to not) offer any advice on proceedings. It is important to be proactive and reach out to OSL for clarifications as they are unlikely to intervene in club proceedings even when they are supposedly kept "in the loop". Additionally, OSL is often privy to the actual approval processes that root oversees. It is advisable to conduct OSL before submitting approvals to ROOT so as to gain an understanding of the approval process and requirements. In the worst case scenario, using OSL's emails could be a way to inform an inexperienced ROOT member on what their roles and responsibilities actually are - in the event that they are unaware of them. 

## Interacting with the Club Professor

As of writing (2018), the club Professor for SOAR is Professor U-Xuan. He is a busy person and would likely be hard to contact via email. If one is to send an email to him, make sure to mark it as high priority. Resend the email as necessary to ensure that he has read it - he has mentioned on multiple occasions that he does not mind. Additionally, he is significantly more responsive on whatsapp, though he will cease all communications during the weekend. Unless he directly contacts another EXCO member, only the club president should be contacting him. This is to prevent unnecessary repeat texts that might cause him to ignore future messages. Successive SOAR presidents are strongly encouraged to request for his phone number from the previous president or from Professor U-Xuan himself.

It is also advisable to schedule a meeting once a month with Professor to update him on club proceedings or milestone. 

As of 2019, Professor U-Xuan requires meetings less frequently as the monthly progress updates are sufficient for him. He may however call for meetings once or twice in a term. More specifically, he may choose to meet or call the club president when a new opportunity presents itself.

Additionally, Professor U-Xuan is now involved in finding more opportunities for the club to grow - which include industry projects that utilize ROS. The president should be ready for him at any time as his correspondence is much more sporadic.

## Interacting with ROOT

Interacting with the student government (ROOT) requires preparation. While ROOT is ostensibly the custodian of student matters, it is unlikely that they will provide valid advisory on aforementioned matters. The EXCO is recommended to do prior research on the formal processes required to attain the necessary approvals before interacting with ROOT. This would minimize miscommunication and misdirection on part of the ROOT point-of-contact a they are often poorly equipped to deal with the matter at hand. 

Without necessary preparation, the ROOT POC would shuttle the request across various ROOT departments as well as potentially redirecting the request to OSL, all without noticeable progress.

It is highly recommended that in most situations, the SOAR EXCO team should seek advice from OSL before dealing with ROOT.
