# Event Planning 101: Finances

> Note: This guide is meant as *a quick-start guide*. It is **not** exhaustive in its coverage, nor is it meant to be.

This guide supplements information found in the 17-page `STUDENT ORGANIATION FINANCE GUIDELINES` prepared by the Office of Student Life (**OSL**), which is quite daunting to look at for new Executive Committee (Exco) members.

For enquiries, contact your cluster rep, or query OSL directly.

And if you do get answers to a question you have which you feel is useful to know in planning an event, feel free to **contribute by submitting Issues or Pull Requests**!

## Claim Forms and Purchase Requests

### Name of Project / Purchase & Purpose

These two fields on the Student Claim Form and Purchase Request Form tend to be confusing, but they need not be identical: The key is to **reflect the purchase correctly:**

|Form | Field | Entry|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Purchase Request Form (PRF) | Name of Project / Purchase | *Reminiscence – White Valentine’s Day Event*
|Student Claim Form (SCF) | Purpose | *Booth decorations for Reminiscence – White Valentine’s Day Event*
| |-OR- |*Logistics for Reminiscence – White Valentine’s Day Event*

### Date & Labelling Protocol

By procedure, any project leader **must** consult their club/project treasurer and submit the Purchase Request Form **before** buying any items.

Hence, the dates written on the Purchase Request Form **must come before** the dates written on the receipts of the purchases.

The format of the form is standard:
> `SCF[last 2 digits of financial year]-[last 3 digits of project code]-[sequential number in 4 digits]`

Example:
> `SCF17-020-0001`

representing a form filed in **FY2017**, for a club/project with code **020**, and indicating that this is the **1st** form they've filed this financial year.

### Signatories and Approval

The rule of thumb is simple: the **claimant** cannot be the **approver.**

This means two things:
1. If the *Treasurer* is claiming a purchase, the *President* needs to approve the Purchase Request Form and verify the Purchase Claim Form.
2. Otherwise, the *Treasurer* does the approval and verification.

## Income Deposit Form 

This form is only applicable if your event **collects money for a club in any way.** If money is spent but not earned, you *do not need to fill this form.*.

### Submission Dates and Labelling

Clubs are *required* to submit the Income Deposit Form to OSL to bank any income collected within **3 working days** of the event's end.

Like the Claim Forms, there is a standard format to the Income Form filing:
> `INC[Last two digits of financial year]-[last 3 digits of project/club code]-[sequential number in 4 digits]`

Example:
> `INC17-020-0001`

representing a form filed in **FY2017**, for a club/project with code **020**, and indicating that this is the **1st** form they've filed this financial year.

### For Interest Groups

Income for interest groups is deposited into a general account and Interest Groups may utilize the income from this account.

Interest Groups only need to **record their income** in the *transaction registers* they maintain. There is no need to forward these transaction registers to the cluster reps.
<!--They are only required to record this income in the transaction register, there is no need to send us the transaction register.-->

**Interest Group Project Codes** should be requested from OSL.

## Receipt Books

Like the Income Deposit Forms, this is only applicable if you **earn money** from the event in **any way.**

### Processes of Use

**Every** club involved in the event *must* send a representative to collect a receipt book from OSL before the event starts, *before the set-up of logistics*, to ensure that each receipt book is **properly accounted for.**

On the event day, clubs **must issue receipts** for **any income collected** on the *official* white SUTD receipts for *each transaction they make with a customer.* (Note that you should keep the non-white sheets, which are carbon copies.) These receipts **must** include the following details:
- Item Purchased
- Amount Paid
- Date
- Signature of Club Member overseeing transaction

### Banking In

Each receipt book **must be accounted for.** The loss of an official SUTD receipt book is *very serious*, and a police report **must be made** in the event that you lose it.

Clubs **must return** the carbon copy segments of the receipt books when they bank in their income, along with the Income Deposit Form. Failure to do so means that the income ***cannot be registered to your club's account***.
