# Finance Guide for Events
<i>Prepared as of 9 February 2019, verified with OSL for content.</i>

This guide is meant to <i>supplement information</i> that is found on the 17-page STUDENT ORGANISATION FINANCE GUIDELINES that were prepared by OSL, which could be daunting for new exco to be looking at.
Please try to look through that guide first before referring to this.

For any other enquiries, please contact your cluster rep or OSL directly. 

And if you do get an answer to a question that isn't covered on either this file or the official finance guide, please help to contribute to this repo with pull requests!

## Claim Form & Purchase Request
1. <b>Name of Project Name/Purchase & Purpose</b>: These two fields on the purchase request and student claim form respectively tends to be confusing, but they actually needs not be identical. They just have to reflect the purchase correctly. An example is shown below.

    > Purchase Request Form - Name of Project Name/Purchase: ‘Reminiscence – White Valentine’s Day Event’ 
<br> Student claim form - Purpose: ‘Booth decorations for Reminiscence – White Valentine’s Day Event’ or ‘Logistics for Reminiscence – White Valentine’s Day Event’.
2. <b>Date</b>: By right, you should have submitted your purchase request form to your treasurer first before proceeding to buy your items. 
Hence the date written on your purchase request form needs to be <b><i>before</i></b> the date recorded on the receipts of your purchases.
3. <b>Labelling protocol</b>: e.g. SCF17-020-0001
    > SCF(last 2 digits of financial year)-(last 3 digits of project code)-(claim sequential number in 4 digits)
4. If anyone else other than the Treasurer is the purchaser, only the Treasurer approves request form & verifies the claim form.
5. But if the Treasurer is the purchaser of the items, then instead of he/she approving, it will be the President approving the purchase request form & verifying the purchase claim form.


## Income Deposit Form
<i> This is applicable to your event if any club involved is earning income from it. </i>
1. <b>Date of Submission</b>: Clubs are required to submit an Income Deposit Form to bank in the generated income within <i>3 working days after the event</i>.
2. <b>Labelling protocol</b>: e.g. INC17-020-0001
    > INC(last 2 digits of financial year)-(last 3 digits of project code)-(sequential number in 4 digits)
    
3. For Interest Groups (IG), 
    - Any income will be deposited into a general account for interest groups and they can still utilize the income from this account.
    - They are only required to record this income in the transaction register, there is no need to send us the transaction register.
    - For IG Project codes, please ask from OSL. 


## Receipt Book
<i> This is applicable to your event if any club involved is earning income from it. </i>
1. <b>Collection</b>: Each club involved in the event is to send a representative to collect the receipt books from OSL before the event starts <i>(even before the collection of logistics)</i>, so that each receipt book is accounted for.
2. <b>Issuing Receipts</b>: On the event day, clubs have to collect a receipt book to record their transactions, in which they have to issue an official white color SUTD receipt <i>for every transaction they make to a customer</i>, with the following information:
    - Item purchased
    - Amount that was paid
    - Date
    - Signature of club member that approved transaction. 
3. <b>Bank in</b>: The club should return the receipt book with the carbon copies(the non-white copies) of all receipts when they bank in the income along with the income deposit form. 

P.S. If you lose the receipt book, things will get very ugly. You have to make a police report and stuff. So just try to return it asap.
